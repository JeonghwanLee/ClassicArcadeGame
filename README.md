# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This is a game that a player passes all enemies to get to a water block. When you get to the water block, the character of the player will change. Let's see how many characters will be shown as you cross the enemies!

## Why did I this project?

This game has a lot of objects and creates a great opportunity to practice **object-oriented programming**. I learnd **JavaScriptâ€™s object oriented programming** features and a variety of ways inheritance and delegation can be used to create well architected and performant applications.

## Usage

You can use this game on any browser wherever a network or WiFi is available. 

## Directions

You can move your player using arrow keys. If the player collides with an enemy, the game will be reset. **When you get to a water block, you need to push up arrow key one more for next stage.** 

## New Methods 

I put some *comments* for new methods I added, so please refer to the comments in *app.js* if you need to know what new methods are added.
